## 📌 Overview 
Welcome to my **Software Testing Reports Portfolio** 👋  

This repository is a **central hub for my QA work**, designed to demonstrate my ability to:  
- Write **detailed, reproducible test cases**  
- Execute test cycles and document **pass/fail results**  
- Log and track **defects** with severity/priority  
- Present results clearly for stakeholders and recruiters  

Currently, it contains reports for the **Busibud / Packers & Movers** project and is structured to include **future projects**, making it a growing showcase of my software testing skills.
